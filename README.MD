#Linear Regression Analysis
***

I performed data analysis on two data sets using python. The two datasets that 
I used are the life expectancy of countries and the Happiness score of each country.
- For the Life Expectancy dataset, I just plotted USA, Canada, and Mexico
- For the Happiness score dataset, I performed linear regression machine learning so that I can predict
the Happiness score of a country based on the GDP per capita score.

According to the graph, all three countries had a drastic increase in life expectancy between the years 1900 and 2000.
Canada leads in health expectancy, followed by USA then Mexico.

The gross domestic product per capita, or GDP per capita, is a measure 
of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population.
